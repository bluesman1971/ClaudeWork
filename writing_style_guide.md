# Trip Master — Writing Style Guide

## The Voice

Write like a knowledgeable friend giving honest travel advice, not a brochure.
Direct, warm, and occasionally dry. No hype. No filler.

## Reference Sample

> "When most people imagine the 'Italian Riviera,' they're thinking of the shimmering resort towns north
> of the Cinque Terre, with their big, stately, Old World hotels looming over crowded pebble beaches.
> Here, fastidiously landscaped parks and promenades are jammed with more Italian visitors than American
> tourists.
>
> These towns can be user-friendly home bases for day trips along the Riviera coast, but they're also
> worth visiting in their own right. After exploring the villages and trails of the Cinque Terre, they
> can feel like a return to civilization — for reasons both good and bad (modern amenities, urban scene,
> traffic).
>
> Levanto, just minutes north by train of the Cinque Terre resort town Monterosso, is the handiest.
> Graced with a long, sandy beach, it's packed in summer with surfers and families. The rest of the year,
> it's just a small, sleepy town with kids playing in the square and locals whizzing around on bicycles."

**Why this works:** It manages expectations honestly, gives practical context (train distance, crowd levels
by season), and earns its one moment of warmth ("kids playing in the square") because everything around
it is matter-of-fact.

## Core Principles

### 1. Lead with the useful fact
Start a description with what the place *is* and *does*, not how it makes you feel.

| ❌ Flowery | ✅ Direct |
|---|---|
| "A breathtaking canvas of golden light..." | "Best light is 6–7am, before the crowds." |
| "An enchanting labyrinth of cobbled streets..." | "Narrow medieval lanes — easy to get lost, easy to find your way back." |
| "A culinary journey that will tantalize your senses..." | "Wood-fired pizza, thin crust, queues out the door by 7pm." |
| "Nestled amidst verdant hillsides..." | "Sits on a ridge above the valley." |

### 2. Be specific, not superlative
Replace vague praise with concrete details.

| ❌ Avoid | ✅ Use instead |
|---|---|
| "world-class", "legendary", "iconic" | What specifically makes it notable |
| "stunning", "breathtaking", "magical" | What you actually see |
| "rich history" | One concrete historical fact |
| "must-see" | Why *this person* should see it |

### 3. Acknowledge trade-offs
Honest writing builds trust. If there's a downside, say so briefly.

> ✅ "Packed in summer, peaceful the rest of the year."
> ✅ "Great value, but cash only and the service is brusque."
> ✅ "The view is worth the climb. The café at the top is not."

### 4. Keep sentences short and varied
Long, clause-heavy sentences slow reading. Mix short punches with longer ones.

> ✅ "Serious hikers can do the no-wimps-allowed hike to Monterosso."
> ❌ "For those who are passionate about trekking and wish to challenge themselves
>     with a more demanding and rigorous hiking experience, the trail to Monterosso
>     offers an exhilarating and rewarding journey."

### 5. Earn your adjectives
Use one vivid, earned adjective rather than three generic ones.

> ✅ "A long, sandy beach" (specific — most Riviera beaches are pebble)
> ❌ "A beautiful, serene, picturesque stretch of golden sand"

### 6. Practical > poetic
Timing, cost, crowd levels, and logistics are more useful than atmosphere words.

> ✅ "Arrive before 9am or after 4pm to avoid tour groups."
> ✅ "No reservations — queue at the door."
> ✅ "15-minute walk from the station; mostly flat."

## Tone by Field

| Field | Tone | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **description** | Plain statement of what it is | "A 13th-century market hall converted into a covered food court." |
| **subject** (photo) | What you're actually pointing at | "The tiled dome seen through a gap in the rooftops across the square." |
| **setup** (photo) | Practical shooting instructions | "Stand at the north corner, 50mm equivalent. Shoot at f/8 for the full depth." |
| **light** | Factual observation | "East-facing facade. Good colour from sunrise until about 9am, flat after that." |
| **pro_tip** | One honest insider note | "Tuesday mornings are quiet. Weekends after 10am are not." |
| **insider_tip** | One actionable piece of advice | "Book the window table when you call. The view from the back is a wall." |
| **ambiance** | Brief, accurate | "Loud, communal, no-frills. Regulars only speak Italian." |

## Things to Avoid

- **Stacked adjectives:** "stunning, vibrant, world-renowned, unforgettable"
- **Filler openers:** "Nestled in...", "Boasting...", "A true gem...", "Steeped in history..."
- **Passive awe:** "You'll be amazed by...", "Prepare to be enchanted..."
- **Redundant qualifiers:** "truly unique", "very special", "absolutely breathtaking"
- **Marketing language:** "curated experience", "bespoke journey", "immersive atmosphere"
- **Clichés:** "hidden gem", "off the beaten path", "a feast for the senses"

## Length Targets

| Field | Target length |
|---|---|
| Restaurant description | 2 sentences. What it is; what's good. |
| Photo subject | 1–2 sentences. What you're shooting and why. |
| Photo setup | 2–3 sentences. Where to stand, what settings. |
| Attraction description | 2–3 sentences. What it is; why it matters; any caveat. |
| Pro tip / insider tip | 1–2 sentences. One actionable point. |

## Quick Self-Check

Before finalising any text, ask:
1. Does every sentence contain at least one *fact* or *action*?
2. Could a tired traveller read this at 8am and act on it?
3. Is there a word I could cut without losing meaning?
4. Have I used any word from the "Things to Avoid" list?

If the answer to 4 is yes, rewrite that sentence.
